# Job Evaluation Framework

<!-- SETUP: Skill match areas and career goals are personalized by running /setup -->

## Scoring Dimensions

Evaluate each job posting against these five dimensions:

### 1. Technical Skills Match (0-100)
How well do the required/preferred skills align with the candidate's capabilities?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80-100 | Core requirements are primary skills |
| 60-79 | Most requirements match, 1-2 gaps that are learnable |
| 40-59 | Partial match, significant upskilling needed |
| 0-39 | Fundamental mismatch |

**Strong match areas:** Technical Program Management, AI/LLM engineering (AWS Bedrock/Claude), GenAI SaaS architecture, AWS cloud platform programs, CI/CD modernization (GitHub Actions, CDK), IaC (Terraform, CDK), observability (Datadog, CloudWatch), SRE program ownership, Python (FastAPI, boto3), security/compliance (SOC 2, ISO, GDPR, IAM)
**Moderate match areas:** SRE/platform engineering as an individual contributor, TypeScript/React development, EKS/Kubernetes, Azure platform programs
**Weak match areas:** Consumer product engineering, mobile development, data science/ML research, front-end design

### 2. Experience Match (0-100)
Does work history align with what they're looking for?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80-100 | Direct experience in the same domain and role type |
| 60-79 | Related experience, transferable skills clear |
| 40-59 | Adjacent experience, would need to make the case |
| 0-39 | Unrelated experience |

**Strong:** AI platform program management, AWS cloud platform delivery, enterprise CI/CD modernization, SRE program ownership, multi-cloud infrastructure programs, government/national-scale platform delivery
**Moderate:** Solo full-stack GenAI SaaS development (MyIQ), AWS partner/consulting delivery, startup engineering leadership (PyCloud)
**Entry-level:** Consumer product, pure IC software engineering roles at FAANG scale

### 3. Behavioral/Culture Fit (0-100)
Does the role and company culture match the behavioral profile?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80-100 | Culture strongly matches behavioral preferences |
| 60-79 | Mixed signals but mostly compatible |
| 40-59 | Some friction areas |
| 0-39 | Significant culture mismatch |

**Red flags to research:** Department disorganization, work dominated by maintenance over development, poor chemistry with leadership, culture mismatches. Check reviews, media coverage, LinkedIn connections, and network contacts for insider perspective.

### 4. Location & Logistics (Pass/Fail + Notes)
- Within commute range: PASS
- Remote with occasional office: PASS
- Requires relocation: FAIL (deal-breaker)
- Frequent international travel: FLAG (discuss with user)

### 5. Career Alignment & Motivation (0-100)
Does this role advance career goals and contain tasks that energize?

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 80-100 | Strongly aligned with career direction, clear growth path |
| 60-79 | Good role but only partially aligned with long-term goals |
| 40-59 | Decent job but doesn't build toward career goals |
| 0-39 | Dead end or backwards step |

**Career goals:**
- Senior Technical Program Manager or Staff TPM at an AI-first or cloud-native company
- Roles where technical depth is respected and required (not just coordination)
- Proximity to AI/LLM infrastructure, GenAI platform delivery, or agentic systems programs
- Long-term: Principal TPM or Director of Engineering Programs at a company building AI at scale

**Motivation filter:** Evaluate not just whether you *can* do the tasks, but whether the tasks will *energize* you. Consider:
- Tasks that energize: building production AI systems, solving reliability/infrastructure problems at scale, partnering directly with CTOs, 0-to-1 program builds, translating ambiguity into execution
- Tasks that drain: high-ceremony governance with no technical depth, status-report-only coordination, being two layers removed from the actual work, environments that don't value technical credibility
- Non-task factors: proximity to engineering leadership, culture of ownership, builder mentality valued

**Life situation alignment:** Consider personal constraints:
- **Security**: Salary minimum $180K USD base; strong equity/bonus upside valued at AI-stage companies
- **Flexibility**: Open to in-person, hybrid, remote — NJ-based but willing to travel or relocate for the right role
- **Professional development**: Wants to deepen AI/agentic systems knowledge; interested in companies building the AI infrastructure layer, not just applying LLMs

### 6. Salary Benchmark (Optional)

If the salary lookup tool is configured (`salary_data.json` exists), look up the company:
```
python salary_lookup.py "<Company Name>" --json
```

If a city is known from the posting, add `--city "<City>"` to narrow results.

Present findings as:
```
### Salary Benchmark
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| [Category] index | XX.X (+/-X.X% vs baseline) |
| Overall index | XX.X (+/-X.X% vs baseline) |
```

Interpret results relative to the baseline defined in the data file's metadata. For index-based data, higher typically means above-market compensation.

If the salary tool is not configured, skip this section.

- **Moderate Fit** (45-59): Consider carefully, discuss with user
- **Weak Fit** (30-44): Probably skip unless strategic reasons
- **Poor Fit** (<30): Skip

## Pre-Application: Call the Employer (Best Practice)

Before writing the application, consider whether the candidate should call the contact person listed in the posting. **Only call if there are substantive questions** - never call just to "be remembered."

### When to Suggest Calling
- The posting has unclear or ambiguous requirements
- It's unclear which competencies are essential vs. nice-to-have
- The role description is vague about day-to-day tasks
- There's a named contact person who invites questions

### Good Questions to Ask
- "What are the primary challenges in this role?"
- "How is time typically divided across the listed responsibilities?"
- "Which competencies are most critical for success in this position?"
- "What does success look like in the first 6-12 months?"

### Rules for the Call
- Prepare a 30-second "elevator pitch" about your background in case they ask
- The call's purpose is **gathering information**, not delivering a pitch
- Take notes - use what you learn to tailor the application
- Reference the conversation naturally in the cover letter ("After speaking with [name], I was especially drawn to...")
